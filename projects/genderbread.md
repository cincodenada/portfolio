Another fairly functional work in progress.  Ever since I saw
[Genderbread 1.0][gb1] making its way across Tumblr as an image
that you downloaded, edited, and re-uploaded, I thought,
*Now there's something just begging to be automated*.  Then
Sam Killerman debuted [Genderbread 2.0][gb2], which cried out even
more plainly for automation.  Then someone in the comments
had the same thought as me (but didn't have the skills), and Sam
said he would love to have an interactive version, but also didn't
have the skills.  So I put together a basic version, basically
just chopping up his graphic into an interactive page, and sent
him a link.

He liked the idea, we went back and forth a bit, he helped with
some additional graphics stuff, and then I (of course) got distracted
before finishing it up.  So it sits, idle, not quite done.  I
want to get the exporting/sharing stuff up before doing anything
with it, since that's part of the core of genderbread.

<h1>Who I am</h1>
<p>
I'm Joel Bradshaw, more frequently known across the internet as cincodenada.
I graduated in 2011 from Seattle Pacfic University with degrees in Computer Science
and Electrical Engineering.  I am currently employed as Lead Software Engineer at SERPs.com,
and reside in Portland, OR.  I have lived in the Pacific Northwest my whole life, and have
would be quite happy to continue doing so - it's a wonderful place.
</p>
<p>
I am an engineer, a coder, a humanist.  I've been taking things apart, figuring out how they
work, and putting them back together as long as I can remember.  I'm inexhaustibly curious,
and spend a lot of time thinking about things.
</p>
<p>
My internet presence is wide and scattered.  Currently most of my blogging happens at
<a href="http://cincodenada.tumblr.com">my Tumblr</a>.  I have
<a href="http://twitter.com/cincodenada">a Twitter handle</a> that I rarely use these days,
and I have infrequently-updated blogs for my
<a href="http://pkconfessional.blogspot.com/">philosophical thoughts</a> and various
<a href="http://commacommacrash.com/">more geeky happenings</a>.  You can, of course, also
find me <a href="http://facebook.com/cincodenada">on Facebook</a>.
